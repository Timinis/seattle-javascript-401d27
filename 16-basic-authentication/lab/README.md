##Lab basic authorization##

We created a basic authorization system with get and post to store username e-mail and password into the mongodb and we used hashing to clear out password.

We later implemented middleware for the get method and were able to compare the password to the right one and get whether it was connect or not.

This is just a basic implementation, will check later for more advanced one.
