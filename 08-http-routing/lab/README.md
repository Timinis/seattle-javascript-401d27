##Using the server file##

To start the server- type in nodemon in the directory containing index.js.
Then head to postman and enter the intended routes

## 1. Upon entering it uses a /get method and grabs the id and send it back as a string

## 2. Upon entering it uses a /delete method and grabs the id and send it back as a string, for now it lacks the ability to delete anything since it is not connected to any database

## 3. To test API method, use postman and do an /api request on POST. then the server sends a response with an string containing the text in JSON format.

# 4. the same goes for Put as POST as of now
